    <h2> A Journey from German Roots to American Citizenship</h2>

        <p class="first">
            Albert Einstein (14 March 1879 – 18 April 1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist, widely recognized as one of the most influential scientists of all time. He is best known for developing the theory of relativity, which, along with quantum mechanics, forms the foundation of modern physics. 
            Einstein was born in the German Empire but moved to Switzerland in 1895, renouncing his German citizenship. He later became a Swiss citizen and maintained this citizenship throughout his life. Einstein graduated from the Swiss Federal Polytechnic School in Zürich in 1900 and later secured a position at the Swiss Patent Office in Bern. In 1905, he earned his PhD from the University of Zurich, marking the beginning of his groundbreaking work.

In 1914, Einstein moved to Berlin, where he joined the Prussian Academy of Sciences and became a professor at the Humboldt University of Berlin. He became a German citizen once again. In 1933, with the rise of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi regime, Einstein, who was Jewish, chose to stay in the United States, where he was later granted American citizenship in 1940. He played a role in alerting President Franklin D. Roosevelt about the potential for German development of nuclear weapons, which led to the U.S. beginning similar research. However, Einstein was deeply conflicted about the use of nuclear weapons.

<h2>Einstein's Scientific Legacy:</h2>
<div class="abc">
    <p>Einstein's work extended beyond physics, significantly influencing the philosophy of science. His most famous work, published in 1905, included papers on the photoelectric effect, Brownian motion, special relativity, and the equivalence of mass and energy. In 1915, he introduced the general theory of relativity, furthering his work on gravity and expanding its implications for understanding the universe.<br>
        In 1921, Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for his contributions to theoretical physics, particularly his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect, which was crucial to the development of quantum theory.<br>
        Later in his career, Einstein contributed to statistical mechanics and quantum theory, particularly in the study of radiation. He also collaborated with Indian physicist Satyendra Nath Bose to lay the foundation for Bose-Einstein statistics. Despite his accomplishments, Einstein spent much of his later years trying to unify the forces of nature through a unified field theory, a pursuit that ultimately isolated him from mainstream physics due to his opposition to the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics. Nevertheless, Einstein remains synonymous with genius and was named Time's Person of the Century in 1999.
